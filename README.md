# SaneVim
This repository is meant to be my personalised Neovim config. I've put it as public so others might learn from it.

## Why "SaneVim"
A lot of ready neovim configs have "Vim" appended to their names like "LazyVim" or "LunarVim". The "Sane" part is because I almost lost my sanity doing it from scratch, but also because the contents of this config are pretty reasonable: not much bloat, good looks (I'm pedantic) and simplicity.
